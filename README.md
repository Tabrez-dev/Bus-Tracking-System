# Bus-Tracking-System

The procedure of tracking a vehicle involves tracking its whereabouts using latitude and longitude coordinates. The objectives we are targeting to fulfill through this project include building a vehicle tracking system that can be managed by an embedded device, more specifically a smartphone and to create and implement a reliable, affordable vehicle tracking system that will help our students, working professionals and citizens who take the BMTC bus. It will also cater to the people who can not use a smartphone, they can receive SMS whenever the bus reaches a bus stop using the SMS service provided by Twilio API instead of using an expensive GSM module to send SMS.
